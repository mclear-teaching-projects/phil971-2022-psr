- Monism is false

  - Spinoza's dogmatism
    - *more geometrico*
  - Incoherence of Spinoza's monism
  - Attestation of consciousness in action
- Distinction between God and nature
- Human beings are free & responsible


# Agreeing with Spinoza

- Transcendental realism entails Spinozism[^2]
- Modal irrealism[^3]
- God as the ultimate basis of unity and systematicity in nature

[^3]: if our understanding were intuitive, it would have no objects except what is
    actual. ... the distinction of possible from actual things is one that is merely
    subjectively valid for the human understanding (CPJ 5:402)

[^2]: If I take space as an entity in itself, then Spinozism is irrefutable, i.e. the
    parts of the world are parts of the Godhead. Space is the Godhead, it is unitary
    \[/einig/\], omnipresent, nothing can be thought outside of it, everything is in
    it (*Metaphysik L~2~* (1790/91?), 28:567).


[^1]: These unavoidable problems of pure reason itself are **God**, **freedom** and
    **immortality**. But the science whose final aim in all its preparations is directed
    properly only to the solution of these problems is called **metaphysics**, whose
    procedure is in the beginning **dogmatic**, i.e., it confidently takes on the
    execution of this task without an antecedent examination of the capacity or
    incapacity' of reason for such a great undertaking (B7)
