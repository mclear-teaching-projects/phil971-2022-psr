# The Need For a Science of Representation

- A science is *systematic*, such that all of its parts manifest a connection
  to, and may be *derived* (in some sense) from the whole
  
> pure reason is such an isolated domain, within itself so thoroughly
> connected, that no part of it can be encroached upon without
> disturbing all the rest, nor adjusted without having previously
> determined for each part its place and its inﬂuence on the others;
> for, since there is nothing outside of it that could correct our
> judgment within it, the validity and use of each part depends on the
> relation in which it stands to the others within reason itself, and,
> as with the structure of an organized body, the purpose of any member
> can be derived only from the complete concept of the whole. That is
> why it can be said of such a critique, that it is never trustworthy
> unless it is entirely complete down to the least elements of pure
> reason, and that in the domain of this faculty one must determine and
> settle either *all or nothing*. (*Prolegomena*, 4:263)


- Why do we need a (new?) foundation for the critical philosophy?
    - The Critical philosophy is a "science of the faculty of cognition" and
      depends on the notion of representation\footnote[][]{If the science of
      the faculty of cognition is to remedy the confusion which has been the
      main pitfall of all previous philosophy . . . it must proceed from the
      concept of representation as such, and exhaustively identify its
      essential characteristics. (Reinhold, \emph{Über das Fundament}, 74; BKH 69)}

- Features of Reinhold's Foundationalism:
  - All science derives from a first principle that is:
    1. Self-evident
    2. A priori
    3. Prior to other a priori elements of science
    4. Universally accepted
    
    
# Reinhold's Representationalism #

The Principle of Consciousness:
:  in consciousness representation is distinguished through the subject from
   both object and subject and is related to both
   
- The Principle of Consciousness is, by being the basis of the Critical
  philosophy, supposed to be the fundamental principle of philosophy and thus
  of science generally)
  - Recognizes a fourfold distinction between representation, object, subject,
    and the distinguishing of this ‘mere’ representation from subject and
    object
   
'Mere' Representation: 
:  that which *can* be related in consciousness to the object and subject and
   is distinguished from both (Reinhold, “New Exposition,” 1:172. Cited by
   Schulze, Aenesidemus, 79)

- Mere representation is cognitively and ontologically prior to the subject
  and object\footnote[][]{[Subject and object] occur in consciousness only
  through the representation, only through the fact that the representation is
  related to them; this, however, is only possible through the fact that the
  mere representation, that is, that which can be related to both of them, is
  present [\emph{vorhanden}] (Reinhold, “New Exposition,” 1:173. Cited by
  Schulze, Aenesidemus, 80)}\footnote[][]{That which is related in
  consciousness to the object and subject must be present—indeed not according
  to time but according to nature—before the acts of being related
  [Bezogenwerden], insofar as nothing can be related, if nothing is present
  [vorhanden] that is able to be related. (Reinhold, “New Exposition,” 1:173.
  Cited by Schulze, Aenesidemus, 80)}
   
Reinholdian Representationalism:
:  (1) all our conscious states are representations; (2) all representations
   have a four-fold structure, consisting of a subject, an object, a
   distinguishing of the mere representation from the subject and object, and
   a relating of the mere representation to the subject and object.
   
- Self-consciousness is a special case of being conscious of the subject, and
  conforms to the Principle of Consciousness\footnote[][]{even with that kind
  of consciousness that is called self-consciousness . . . the representing
  thing [das Vorstellende] as subject and as object, as the representing thing
  that thinks and as the representing thing that is thought, are
  distinguished. In the first respect, it behaves as the thing that
  distinguishes through the representation; in the second, as the thing
  distinguished through the representation—as representing and as represented.
  As the thing that distinguishes it cannot simultaneously be the thing that
  is distinguished (just as little as the eye can see itself) (Reinhold, “New
  Exposition,” 1:197. Cited by Schulze, Aenesidemus, 312)}

# Schulze's Criticisms

- Against the existence of a faculty of representation
    1. There is no secure inference from how we have to think to how things in
       fact are
    2. Inference from the existence of a representation to the existence of a
       faculty of representation is inconsistent with the Critical philosophy
    3. There is no secure inference from properties of representation to the
       properties of any faculty 
    4. The appeal to powers explains nothing

\newpage

- Against the Principle of Consciousness
    1. The PC is not the highest principle since it is subject to the principle
       of contradiction
    2. Some conscious representations are representations that fail to conform to the PC
        - deep reflection
        - primitive mental states (e.g. sensation in small children)
        - intuition\footnote[][-25in]{I indeed notice [\emph{bemerke}] my “I,” which
          intuits, and a representation, which constitutes the content of the
          intuition; however, in this intuition and during it, there is no
          perception [\emph{Gewahrnehmung}] of an object that is distinct from my “I”
          and the representation that is present in it. (Schulze, Aenesidemus, 72)}

    3. Reinhold's own views require that mere representation is derivative
       rather than fundamental\footnote[][-.25in]{For if a representation is made up
       only of something that is distinguished by the subject from the object
       and subject, and is related to both; if it is certain, moreover, that
       only something that has been perceived [\emph{was gewahrgenommen worden
       ist}] can be distinguished from, and related to, something else by the
       mind (for the operation of distinguishing and relating can occur only
       if there is something there that can be related to, and distinguished
       from, something else; and where there is nothing present
       [\emph{vorhanden}] that can be distinguished, “distinguishing” cannot
       be thought of at all), then it follows that “intuition” is not a
       species of the genus “representation” because the concept of the genus
       is not applicable to it at all. During the intuiting no distinction of
       an object from a representation occurs, because for as along as the
       intuition lasts, no object at all different from it is noted
       [\emph{bemerkt}] (Schulze, Aenesidemus, 84–85)}
    4. Reinhold's conception of self-consciousness is problematic:
        - The subject seems to represent itself even when not conscious in a
          manner conforming to the Principle of Consciousness
        - Reinholdian self-representation is not obviously possible (i.e. how
          does the subject distinguish itself from itself?)
        - The status of first-person representation confronts a
          dilemma (see Messina 2011, 360)
        - Self-consciousness is implausibly portrayed as always
          present\footnote[][]{Thus, self-consciousness is not only present in
          us when the representing “I” constitutes the object of a special
          representation, but rather also in general when the representing
          thing, as a representing thing, is distinguished from the
          representation and from the object, or when the representing “I” is
          perceived as existing; and one is conscious of oneself as soon as
          and insofar as one distinguishes the thinking “I” from some kind of
          a thought or from the object of the thought. (Schulze, Aenesidemus, 350)}


# Fichte's Review

- Against Schulze Fichte accepts Reinhold's Principle of Consciousness but
  with Schulze he denies that it can be the highest principle of
  philosophy\footnote[][]{all the objects of Aenesidemus are groundless in so
  far as they are to be taken as directed against the truth of the principle
  of consciousness as such, but that they are relevant to it as first
  principle of all philosophy and as a mere fact; thus the objections make a
  new justification necessary. (Fichte, BKH 142)}
- With Reinhold, Fichte claims that (1) “all that is discovered in the mind is
  a representing,” and (2) representation “is undeniably an empirical
  determination of the mind.” (BKH 140)
  
\newpage

- Against Reinhold Fichte claims that there are pre-representational acts of
  the mind that make representation possible
    - The "positing" [*Setzung*] of self and object in intellectual
      intuition\footnote[][]{The absolute subject, the ego, is not given in an
      empirical intuition, but is posited through an intellectual one; and the
      absolute object, the non-ego, is what is posited in opposition to it. In
      empirical consciousness, both occur in no other way than by a
      representation being referred to them. They are in it only mediately,
      qua representing, and qua represented. But the absolute subject, that
      which represents but is not represented; and the absolute object . . .
      of these one will never become conscious as something empirically given.
      (Fichte, BKH 142)}
        - Is Fichte's notion of positing related to Kant's?\footnote[][]{The
          concept of positing [\emph{Position}] or setting [\emph{Setzung}] is perfectly
          simple: it is identical with the concept of being in general. Now
          something can be thought as posited merely relatively, or to express
          the matter better, it can be thought merely as the relation
          (\emph{respectus logicus}) of something as a characteristic mark of a
          thing. In this case, being, that is to say, the positing of this
          relation, is nothing other than the copula in a judgment. If what is
          considered is not merely the relation but the thing posited in and
          for itself, then this being is the same as existence. (OPG, 2:73)}
     - Why does Fichte emphasize (BKH 141) the importance of the first principle of
       philosophy as expressing a fact not as *content* but as "performance"
       (*eine Tathandlung*)?
