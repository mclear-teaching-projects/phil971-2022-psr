# Nature & Ends

End/purpose:
  :  that which is produced by the causality of a concept (e.g. an artifact)[^2]

[^2]: the object of a concept insofar as the latter is regarded as the cause of the former (§10, 5:220)
  
Natural end/purpose:
  : products of nature that are themselves ends, in which the parts are (i)
  possible in virtue of their relation to the whole; and (ii) reciprocally
  cause one another[^3]

[^3]: Now for a thing as a natural end it is requisite, ﬁrst, that its parts
  (as far as their existence and their form are concerned) are possible only
  through their relation to the whole. ... then it is required, second, that
  its parts be combined into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and
  effect of their form. (§65, 5:373)
  
- The paradoxical character of natural ends/purposes
    * If something is natural, then it is not the product of design (it is not
      an artifact)
    * If something is an end, then it is produced in accordance with some
      conceptualized aim
- How (if at all) does Kant resolve this paradox?

## Features of Natural Ends

1. Reproduction[^4]
2. Self-maintained/organized[^5]
3. Parts exhibit reciprocal dependence[^6]

- Explanation of these features in terms of a "formative power" (*bildende
  Kraft*)[^7]

## Objections

1. Might there be objects whose parts are made possible in virtue of their
   relation to a whole, but which do not reciprocally cause one another?
   - Organisms as just more complex machines (artifacts)
   - Possibility of "encasement" theories of species propagation
   
2. Might there be organisms that satisfy at least some of (1)-(3) but lack a
   formative power?[^8]

# Mechanism

Lockean Mechanism:
  : All macroscopic bodily phenomena should be explained in terms of the
  motions and impacts of submicroscopic particles, or corpuscles, each of
  which can be fully characterized in terms of a strictly limited range of
  properties: viz. extension and its modes (e.g. size, shape, motion (or
  mobility), number and, perhaps, solidity or impenetrability).

Kantian Mechanism:
  : All macroscopic bodily phenomena (that are not themselves living
  organisms) should be understood as wholes that exist in virtue of their
  parts, and that possess causal powers entirely in virtue of the causal
  powers of their parts[^112351]\marginnote{  }
  
- Is Kantian mechanism *reductive*?

# Two Kinds of Judgment[^112350]

Determining Judgment:
  :  The faculty of judgment acting in accordance with a given concept or universal

Reflective Judgment:
  :  The faculty of judgment acting in search of a concept or universal
  
- This distinction is not present in the first *Critique*

# The Antinomy of Judgment[^1]

[^1]: The **ﬁrst maxim** of the power of judgment is the **thesis**: All
    generation of material things and their forms must be judged as possible
    in accordance with merely mechanical laws. The **second maxim** is the
    **antithesis**: Some products of material nature cannot be judged as
    possible according to merely mechanical laws (judging them requires an
    entirely different law of causality, namely that of ﬁnal causes). Now if
    one were to transform these regulative principles for research into
    constitutive principles of the possibility of the objects themselves...as
    objective principles for the determining power of judgment, they would
    contradict one another, and hence one of the two propositions would
    necessarily be false; but that would then be an antinomy, though not of
    the power of judgment, but rather a conﬂict in the legislation of reason.
    However, reason can prove neither the one nor the other of these
    fundamental principles, because we can have no determining principle a
    priori of the possibility of things in accordance with merely empirical
    laws of nature. (5:387)

Thesis: 
  :  All generation of material things is possible in accordance with merely mechanical laws.

Antithesis: 
  :  Some generation of such things is not possible in accordance with merely mechanical laws.

## Reason as Regulative ##

Constitutive Principle:
  : A principle that is constitutive of the objects of experience (e.g. the
  Second Analogy principle that every event has a cause)

Regulative Principle:
  : A principle that serves to unify, simplify and systematize concepts, and
  direct the understanding (the faculty of concepts) to its greatest extent,
  with a view to arriving at a systematically unified whole of knowledge (a
  '*scientia* or *Wissenschaft*)

- Reason lacks a 'constitutive' use in that it has no genuine objects, other than what may be given to it by the understanding (A643-4/B671-2)
- The error of traditional metaphysics is thus to mistake a 'regulative' principle for a 'constitutive' one[^112349]

[^112349]: the transcendental ideas are never of constitutive use, so that the
concepts of certain objects would thereby be given, and in case one so
understands them, they are merely sophistical (dialectical) concepts...however,
they have an excellent and indispensably necessary regulative use...of
directing the understanding (A644/672)

[^111732]: This unity is, of course, only a ‘projected’ unity (A647/B675), a
mere ideal, but it has significance for how we approach the empirical world.
Kant gives the following illustrations: under pressure from reason, we will
search for fundamental (chemical) elements and powers in nature (A646/B674,
A648–9/B676–7), employ concepts of ideal entities not to be found in nature
(e.g. pure earth, water and air, A646/B674), develop hypotheses advancing
universal laws of nature (A646–7/B674–5) and classify the organic and inorganic
natural worlds into genera and species (A653–7/B681–5). The operative maxims
are the three principles of ‘genera’, ‘specification’ and ‘affinity’,
instructing us to seek out respectively ‘homogeneity’, ‘variety’ and
‘continuity’ among natural forms (A651–64/B679–92). (@gardner1999, 144)

## Resolving the Antinomy ##

- Kant's strategy seems to hinge on recognizing that the thesis & antithesis
  are merely regulative
    - But does this resolve the antinomy?
        - Not clear how even if thesis and antithesis are both regulative,
          that they are thereby compatible with one another
- Why is it that organisms are mechanically inexplicable?

- McLaughlin's proposal
    - Mechanism is a species of causality
    - To explain a natural object mechanically is to explain the way in which
      the parts of an object determine the whole
        - Mechanical explanations are reductive; a mechanical object is
          explained entirely in terms of the forces and faculties of its parts
    - Why must we strive to explain nature mechanically?
        - Because the nature of the discursive faculty is to move from part to
          whole -- this is merely a subjective fact about our faculties, which
          admits of no further explanation
    - Antinomy is resolved by denying that we can explain organisms
- Ginsborg's proposal[^112352]
    - Mechanism is a species of empirical causal law
    - A mechanical explanation in the third *Critique* explains a material
      object by reference to the attractive and repulsive forces which are
      fundamental to matter
          - Mechanical explanation of things instead of events (as in 2^nd Analogy)
    - Antinomy is resolved by differentiating a wide and narrow sense of
      mechanical explanation, and arguing only for the possibility of the latter
          - Wide: Accounting for the existence of an organism in terms of the
            fundamental powers of inorganic matter
          - Narrow: Accounting the for the existence of an organism in terms
            of the powers of organized matter

[^4]: First, a tree generates another tree in accordance with a known natural
    law. (§64, 5:371)

 
[^5]: Second, a tree also generates itself as an individual. This sort of
    effect we call, of course, growth; but this is to be taken in such a way
    that it is entirely distinct from any other increase in magnitude in
    accordance with mechanical laws, and is to be regarded as equivalent,
    although under another name, with generation. (§64, 5:371)

[^6]: Third, e one part of this creature also generates itself in such a way
    that the preservation of the one is reciprocally dependent on the
    preservation of the other. (§64, 5:371)

[^7]: An organized being is thus not a mere machine, for that has only a
    motive power, while the organized being possesses in itself a formative
    power, and indeed one that it communicates to the matter, which does not
    have it (it organizes the latter): thus it has a self-propagating
    formative power, which cannot be explained through the capacity for
    movement alone (that is, mechanism). (§65, 5:374)

[^8]: [organisms] might be compared to weather systems (tornadoes, say) which
    do indeed preserve and reproduce themselves to some extent, but where this
    self-preserving character is simply a reﬂection of the more basic physical
    forces that were responsible for their formation in the ﬁrst place.
    [@ginsborg2006b, 458-9]

[^112350]: Judgment in general is the ability to think the particular as
    contained under the universal. If the universal (the rule, principle, law)
    is given, then judgment, which subsumes the particular under it, is
    determinative (even though [in its role] as transcendental judgment it
    states a priori the conditions that must be met for subsumption under that
    universal to be possible). But if only the particular is given and
    judgment has to find the universal for it, then this faculty is merely
    reflective. (5:179)

[^112351]: if we consider a material whole, as far as its form is concerned,
    as a product of the parts and of their forces and their capacity to
    combine by themselves (including as parts other materials that they add to
    themselves), we represent a mechanical kind of generation. (§77, 5:408)

[^112352]: we accord with the mechanical principle insofar as we explain the
    origin of organisms by appeal to the intrinsic powers of the “matter” out
    of which they come to be. But ... the matter to which we appeal is
    organized matter endowed with the kind of formative power which makes
    possible an organism’s capacities of self-maintenance and reproduction ...
    And the possibility of this kind of matter is intelligible only on the
    assumption that it is teleologically directed towards the production of
    the organisms which it makes possible. [@ginsborg2006b, 463]
