# The Protean Schelling

1. **The Early (Fichtean) Period** (1794-1796). 
2. **The Early Philosophy of Nature** (1797-1800). 
3. **The Philosophy of Identity** (1801-1805). 
4. **The Middle Period (Philosophy of Freedom)** (1809-1815). 
5. **The Late Period (Positive Philosophy)** (1820-1850). 

- The *First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature* (1799) is part of the
  "early" philosophy of Nature and marks the beginning of Schelling's break with
  Fichte. 
  
  
# Schelling's Naturphilosophie

Naturphilosophie: 
:   Nature is dynamic and productive Being (*Natura naturans*) from which all other
  particular beings (*Natura naturata*), including self-conscious rational subjects,
  are derived
  
      1. *Realism*: Nature exists independently of (or metaphysically prior to) all
         forms of consciousness, even that of the transcendental subject.
      2. *Naturalism*: Everything, including the rational/transcendental subject, is
         applicable in terms of the laws of nature.


# The Kantian Problematic

## Nature & Ends ##

End/purpose:
  :  that which is produced by the causality of a concept (e.g. an artifact)[^2]

[^2]: the object of a concept insofar as the latter is regarded as the cause of the former (§10, 5:220)
  
Natural end/purpose:
  : products of nature that are themselves ends, in which the parts are (i)
  possible in virtue of their relation to the whole; and (ii) reciprocally
  cause one another[^3]

[^3]: Now for a thing as a natural end it is requisite, ﬁrst, that its parts
  (as far as their existence and their form are concerned) are possible only
  through their relation to the whole. ... then it is required, second, that
  its parts be combined into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and
  effect of their form. (§65, 5:373)

## Efficient/Mechanical vs Final Causation
  
Final Causation:
:  The representation (concept) of an end is the cause of that end (as an effect)[^8]

Efficient Causation:
:  The cause is metaphysically (and temporally) prior to the effect[^9]


[^9]: The causal nexus, insofar as it is conceived merely by the understanding, is a
    connection that constitutes a series (of causes and effects) that is always
    descending; and the things themselves, which as effects presuppose others as
    their causes, cannot conversely be the causes of these at the same time. This
    causal nexus is called that of efﬁcient causes (*nexus effectivus*). In contrast,
    however, a causal nexus can also be conceived in accordance with a concept of
    reason (of ends), which, if considered as a series, would carry with it
    descending as well as ascending dependency, in which the thing which is on the
    one hand designated as an effect nevertheless deserves, in ascent, the name of a
    cause of the same thing of which it is the effect. (CPJ §65, 5:372-3)


[^8]: an end is the object of a concept insofar as the latter is regarded as the
    cause of the former (the real ground of its possibility); and the causality of a
    **concept** with regard to its **object** is purposiveness (*forma ﬁnalis*). Thus
    where not merely the cognition of an object but the object itself (its form or
    its existence) as an effect is thought of as possible only through a concept of
    the latter, there one thinks of an end. The representation of the effect is here
    the determining ground of its cause, and precedes the latter. (CPJ §10, 5:219-20)

## Features of Natural Ends ##

1. Reproduction[^4]
2. Self-maintained/organized[^5]
3. Parts exhibit reciprocal dependence[^6]

- Explanation of these features in terms of a "formative force" (*bildende
  Kraft*)[^7]

## The Paradoxical Character of Natural Ends/Purposes

- If something is natural, then it is not the product of design (it is not an
      artifact or product of final causation)
- If something is an end, then it is produced in accordance with some conceptualized
      aim (i.e. it *is* a product of final causation)
- This conflict is expressed in the antinomy in terms of two theses:

Thesis:
:   All generation of material things is possible in accordance with
    merely mechanical laws.

Antithesis:
:   Some generation of such things is not possible in accordance with
    merely mechanical laws.

\newthought{How (if at all) does Kant resolve this paradox?}

- Kant's strategy seems to hinge on recognizing that the thesis & antithesis
  are merely *regulative*
  
Constitutive Principle:
  : A principle that is constitutive of the objects of experience (e.g. the
  Second Analogy principle that every event has a cause)

Regulative Principle:
  : A principle that serves to unify, simplify and systematize concepts, and
  direct the understanding (the faculty of concepts) to its greatest extent,
  with a view to arriving at a systematically unified whole of knowledge (a
  '*scientia* or *Wissenschaft*)

- But does this distinction resolve the antinomy?
    - Not clear how even if thesis and antithesis are both regulative,
      that they are thereby compatible with one another
    - Why exactly is it that organisms are mechanically inexplicable?


[^4]: First, a tree generates another tree in accordance with a known natural
    law. (§64, 5:371)

 
[^5]: Second, a tree also generates itself as an individual. This sort of
    effect we call, of course, growth; but this is to be taken in such a way
    that it is entirely distinct from any other increase in magnitude in
    accordance with mechanical laws, and is to be regarded as equivalent,
    although under another name, with generation. (§64, 5:371)

[^6]: Third, one part of this creature also generates itself in such a way
    that the preservation of the one is reciprocally dependent on the
    preservation of the other. (§64, 5:371)

[^7]: An organized being is thus not a mere machine, for that has only a
    motive power, while the organized being possesses in itself a formative
    power, and indeed one that it communicates to the matter, which does not
    have it (it organizes the latter): thus it has a self-propagating
    formative power, which cannot be explained through the capacity for
    movement alone (that is, mechanism). (§65, 5:374)


# Nature as Productive & as Product

- Tenets of Schelling's *Naturphilosophie*:[^10]

[^10]: Here, before we proceed to anything else, we shall briefly divide the
whole of Nature into *Natura naturans* and *Natura naturata*. By *Natura
naturans* we understand a being that we conceive clearly and distinctly
through itself, without needing anything other than itself (like all the
attributes which we have so far described), that is, God. The Thomists
have also understood God by this phrase, but their *Natura naturans* was
a being (as they called it) beyond all substances. (1:47-8).


1.  Nature is inherently productive
2.  Nature as being and nature as product are distinct conceptions
3.  The conception of self-consciousness is (merely?) the highest form, potency, or
    expression of the productive forces of nature
4.  Nature is the \"indifference\" or basis of subject-object duality;
    otherwise expressed as the \"absolute identity\" of subject and
    object in nature
5.  Intellectual intuition is the non-discursive act of grasping the
    absolute (or the identity/indifference of subject and object)
