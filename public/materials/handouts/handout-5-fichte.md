# What is a "Wissenschaftslehre"?

- A "Wissenschaftslehre" (WL), or "Doctrine of Science", is Fichte's name for the
  fundamental science to which all other human knowledge is related

## Fichte on Science

- Features of Science:
  1. Certain
  2. Systematic
  3. Explanatory
- All sciences need a fundamental or "first" principle
- The first principle of the WL, as the science of science, is the most fundamental
  principle of all, though it is not the first principle of every other science (they
  each have their own)
- Each science can have one and only one first principle\footnote{In each science
  there can be only one proposition that is certain and established prior to the
  connection between the propositions. Were there several such propositions, then
  either they would have no connection at all with the other proposition that is
  certain and established prior to the connection, or else they would be connected to
  it. In the first case they would not then be part of the same whole, but would
  constitute one or more separate wholes. But the only way in which propositions are
  supposed to be connected to each other is by sharing a common certainty, so that if
  one is certain then another one must also be certain, and if one is uncertain then
  the other one must also be uncertain; and all that is supposed to determine the
  connection between the two propositions is the relation of the certainty of the one
  to the certainty of the other. But a proposition which possesses its own certainty
  independently of the other propositions could not be connected with them in this
  manner. If its certainty is independent then it remains certain even if the others
  are not. Consequently, such a proposition would not be connected via certainty with
  the other propositions at all. A proposition of this sort, one which is certain
  prior to and independently of the association with others, is termed a first
  principle. … a science can have no more than one first principle, for if it had
  more than one it would be several sciences rather than one. (SW 1:41-2)}

\newthought{Fichte's Uniqueness Argument}

1. A science is a systematic whole (i.e. a whole whose parts are all connected).
2. The connection of each part (proposition) to another (and thus to the whole)
   involves the “transmission” of certainty.
3. The certainty of any part of the whole ultimately depends on the certainty of the
   first principle.
4. If there was more than one first principle than either (a) its certainty is
   independent of all the other parts of the science or (b) its certainty is
   dependent on some other part.
5. If (a) then the proposition cannot be part of the systematic whole that is the science.
6. If (b) then the proposition cannot be a first principle
7. Therefore there can be only one first principle of any science.


- Q: Is the first principle the ground of knowledge (i.e. an epistemic ground), or is
  it also a ground of truth (i.e. a metaphysical ground)?
  
# Critique & Wissenschaftslehre

- Critique and WL are distinct elements of Fichte's philosophy
- The WL answers the question "how is science possible?"\footnote{How are the form
  and content of a science possible at all, that is, how is science possible? (1:43)}
- Critique answers the question "how is a science of science
  possible?"\footnote{There can be a doctrine of transcendental philosophy, or
  \emph{Wissenschaftslehre}. {[}There can also be{]} a theory thereof which deals
  with issues such as how it {[}viz., the /Wissenschaftslehre/{]} is to be achieved
  and with what right, that is, with the sort of validity it has. The former is based
  upon the latter. My book \emph{Concerning the Concept of the Wissenschaftslehre}.
  Parts of the \emph{Critique of Pure Reason}. (GA 4:53).}
- Critique cannot, however, be carried out separately from the project of the
  WL\footnote{A science and the critique of that science support and explain each
  other reciprocally. It will not become easy to render a systematic and complete
  account of the procedure of the \emph{Wissenschaftslehre} until it is possible to
  provide a pure exposition of this science itself. (SW 1:34)}

# Dogmatism & Idealism[^1]

[^1]: by means of a free act of thinking he is able to separate things that are
connected with each other within experience. The *thing*, i.e., a determinate
something that exists independently of our freedom and to which our cognition is
supposed to be directed, and the *intellect*, i.e., the subject that is supposed to
be engaged in this activity of cognizing, are inseparably connected with each other
within experience. The philosopher is able to abstract from either one of these, and
when he does so he has abstracted from experience and has thereby succeeded in
elevating himself above experience. If he abstracts from the thing, then he is left
with an intellect in itself as the explanatory ground of experience; that is to say,
he is left with the intellect in abstraction from its relationship to experience. If
he abstracts from the intellect, then he is left with a thing in itself (that is, in
abstraction from the fact that it occurs within experience) as the explanatory ground
of experience. The first way of proceeding is called *idealism*, the second is called
*dogmatism*. (SW 1:425-6)


Idealism:
:   The philosophical system that takes the free, self-positing subject
    (or \'I\') as its starting point

Dogmatism:
:   The philosophical system that takes the object (or thing in itself)
    as its starting point


- Dogmatism & Idealism oppose one another, but each cannot *refute* the other
- Fichte construes dogmatism, as opposed to idealism, as ultimately committed to
  atheism, materialism, and hard determinism

# Problems for Dogmatism

1. Denies freedom
3. Can only allow material beings
2. Denies (or cannot explain) the existence of consciousness

# Idealism

- Idealism concerns the acts of an intelellect whose nature is such as to be
understood in terms of a set of determinate, systematically related laws (1:441)
- Two forms of idealism
  - "lower" idealism: Categorial acts of intellect are basic
  - "higher" idealism: Categorial acts of intellect are derived
- Fichte contends that the cateogories are 'derived' directly from the nature of the
  intellect as activity (i.e. from the self-posited I or "I am") rather than from the
  nature of judgment or the structure of logic
  - The derivation of the categories is via a "regressive" or "transcendental"
    argument from a conditioned fact to its conditions until we reach an
    unconditioned (i.e. the first principle "I am")\footnote{It shows that what is
    postulated as the first principle and immediately established within
    consciousness is not possible unless something else occurs as well, and that this
    second thing is not possible apart from the occurrence of some third thing. It
    continues in this manner until all of the conditions of the first principle have
    been completely exhausted and its possibility has become completely
    comprehensible. It proceeds in an uninterrupted progression from what is
    conditioned to the condition of the same. Each condition becomes, in turn,
    something that is itself conditioned and whose condition has to be discovered.
