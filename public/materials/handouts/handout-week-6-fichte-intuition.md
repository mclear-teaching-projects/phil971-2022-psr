# Fichte's Absolute Subject #

- Features of the absolute I
    1. Self-positing (I:489)
    2. Exists as an act/activity (*Tathandlung*) not a fact (*Tatsache*) (I:465)
    3. Represented via intellectual intuition (§5)
    4. Presupposed in all representational consciousness (I:462)
    5. Knowable only via the moral law (I:466)

## The 'I' as Activity ##

- If the I is "self-positing" the does this mean that it creates itself? Is
  this notion related to Kant's?\footnote[][-2in]{The concept of positing
  [\emph{Position}] or setting [\emph{Setzung}] is perfectly simple: it is
  identical with the concept of being in general. Now something can be thought
  as posited merely relatively, or to express the matter better, it can be
  thought merely as the relation (\emph{respectus logicus}) of something as a
  characteristic mark of a thing. In this case, being, that is to say, the
  positing of this relation, is nothing other than the copula in a judgment.
  If what is considered is not merely the relation but the thing posited in
  and for itself, then this being is the same as existence. (Kant, OPG 2:73)}
- Why must the I be understood as an activity rather than a fact?
    - Is there a similarity/affinity here between Fichte's position and
      Shoemaker's arguments against self-consciousness as a form of inner
      sense?
      - Introspection does not afford object awareness because there is no "in
        view of" relation which one can enjoy in introspection\footnote[][]{If we
        expand condition (3) by saying that perception involves
        "object-awareness" and that object-awareness of a thing involves having
        to it a kind of relation such that, first, it is possible for one to have
        this relation to any of a range of different objects, and, second, having
        this relation to an object enters into the causal explanation of one's
        knowing facts of a certain kind about it, then it is clear that
        introspective awareness of the self does not satisfy it. (Shoemaker 1994,
        257)}
      - Introspection does not depend, as perception does, on the possession of
        identifying information about oneself\footnote[][]{there is no such role
        for awareness of oneself as an object to play in explaining my
        introspective knowledge that I am hungry, angry, or alarmed. This comes
        out in the fact that there is no possibility here of a misidentification;
        if I have my usual access to my hunger, there is no room for the thought
        "Someone is hungry all right, but is it me?".... In general,
        identification-based first-person knowledge must be grounded in
        first-person knowledge that is not identification-based; and the making
        of introspective judgments is one of the main cases in which this occurs
        (Shoemaker 1994, 258)}
      - Mental states are not really related to as "particulars" in any case; one
        cannot just "happen upon" them (Shoemaker 1994, 259-60)
- In what sense is the 'absolute' I an activity rather than a
  being?\footnote[][]{What "acting" is is something that can only be intuited;
  such knowledge cannot be developed from concepts nor can it be communicated
  thereby. But what is contained within this intuition becomes comprehended
  through its opposition to mere \emph{being}. "Acting is not being, and being
  is not acting": this is the only definition of acting one can obtain from
  its mere concept. In order to understand the true nature of acting, one has
  to turn to intuition. (Fichte, I:461)}
  
  
## Intellectual Intuition ##

- Features of intellectual intuition
    1. No distinction between intuition and its object
    2. Occurrence of intuition is a function of subject's spontaneity
    3. Intuition provides an "immediate awareness" of subject's existence
    4. Intellectual intuition is ubiquitous\footnote[][]{intellectual
       intuition occurs at every moment of...consciousness. I cannot take a
       step, move hand or foot, without an intellectual intuition of my
       self-consciousness in these acts; only so do I know that I do it, only
       so do I distinguish my action, and myself therein, from the object of
       action before me. (Fichte, I:463)}
    5. Always conjoined with a sensory
       representation\footnote[][]{intellectual intuition is also constantly
       conjoined with an intuition of \emph{sense}. (Fichte, I:464)}
       
\vspace{-5mm}
\newthought{Questions:}

- How should we characterize the sort of awareness that intellectual intuition
  provides?
    - *Reflective*: a higher-order state resulting from the subject's
      directing its attention to itself and making its subjectivity the
      object of awareness
    - *Pre-reflective*: a first-order state of object awareness where the
      subject is nevertheless always in a position to assess the activity fo
      thought as one's own
- How is the immediacy of this awareness compatible with intellectual
  intuition not itself being a part of empirical consciousness and instead
  being a kind of theoretical posit?\footnote[][]{if it has to be admitted
  that there is no immediate, isolated consciousness of intellectual
  intuition, how does the philosopher then arrive at the knowledge and
  isolated presentation of the same? I answer: ... [by] an inference from the
  obvious facts of consciousness. (Fichte, I:464-5)}

# Fichte & Kant #

- To what extent is Fichtean intellectual intuition in opposition to Kant's account?
    - Differences from Kant's usage
        1. Intellectual intuition does not create things in themselves (I:472)
        2. Intellectual intuition is not a consciousness of a thing in itself (I:472)
        3. Intellectual intuition is always directed at an activity rather
           than a being\footnote[][-1.75in]{The intellectual intuition of which the
           \emph{Wissenschaftslehre} speaks is not directed towards any sort
           of being whatsoever; instead it is directed at an acting---and this
           is something Kant does not even mention (except, perhaps, under the
           name "pure apperception"). (Fichte, I:472)}
    - Similarities to Kant's conception of pure apperception
        1. Form of awareness of one's own activity
        2. Always an awareness that entails existence
        3. Explains the ownership of one's representations
        4. Not a form of awareness of one's individuality
        5. Always requires the existence of an empirical intuition

# The Unity of Reason

## Kant on the Unity of Reason

- Kant speaks of "reason" (*Vernunft*) as a unitary faculty with a "common
  principle"\footnote[][-2.35in]{Nothing here can escape us, because what reason
  brings forth entirely out of itself cannot be hidden, but is brought to
  light by reason itself as soon as reason's common principle
  (\emph{gemeinschaftliches Prinzip}) has been discovered (Axx)}
- **Q~1~**: In what sense is the faculty of theoretical reason, which pursues the
  systematicity of its cognitions, identical with the faculty of practical
  reason, which binds the causally unconditioned aspect of the rational
  (human) will by (categorical) laws?\footnote[][-2.25in]{[A critique of pure
  practical reason] is not of such utmost necessity as [a critique of pure
  theoretical reason], because in moral matters human reason can easily be
  brought to a high degree of correctness and accomplishment, even in the most
  common understanding, whereas in its theoretical but pure use it is wholly
  dialectical [i.e., a source of illusion]\ldots I require that the critique
  of pure practical reason, if it is to be carried through completely, be able
  at the same time to present the unity of practical with speculative reason
  in a common principle, since there can, in the end, be only one and the same
  reason, which must be distinguished merely in its application. (G
  4:391)}\footnote[][]{if pure reason of itself can be and really is
  practical, as the consciousness of the moral law proves it to be, it is
  still only one and the same reason which, whether from a theoretical or a
  practical perspective, judges according to a priori principles (CPrR 5:121)}
  - Is the categorical imperative the supreme or "common" principle of
    reason?\footnote[][]{To make use of one’s own reason means no more than
    to ask oneself, whenever one is supposed to assume something, whether
    one could find it feasible to make the ground or the rule on which one
    assumes it into a universal principle for the use of reason. (OT 8:146n)}
- **Q~2~**: In what sense does practical reason have
  "primacy"?\sidenote[][]{in the union of pure speculative with pure practical
  reason in one cognition, the latter has primacy, assuming that this union is
  not \emph{contingent} and discretionary but based a priori on reason itself
  and therefore \emph{necessary}. \ldots{} [O]ne cannot require pure practical
  reason to be subordinate to speculative reason and so reverse the order,
  since all interest is ultimately practical and even that of speculative
  reason is only conditional and is complete in practical use alone. (CPrR
  5:121)}

## O'Neil's Interpretive Proposal

- The categorical imperative (or the moral law) is the principle unifying all of reason's activity

1. The practical use of reason is more fundamental than its theoretical/speculative use
2. The Categorical Imperative is the supreme principle of practical reason
3. $\therefore$ The Categorical Imperative is the supreme principle of reason

\newpage

## Fichte's Position

- (Wood) The deliberative perspective of the agent is presumed for all activity,
  including all "theoretical" activity concerning what to believe\footnote{the first
  person standpoint is distinctive...only because it is not originally and
  fundamentally a cognitive standpoint at all, but instead the standpoint of an agent,
  so that what is most distinctive about it is not the way it enables us to know
  certain things, but rather the fact that it is that unique viewpoint on the world
  from which things can be done. (Wood 2000, 102)}
- Self-consciousness is a "free act" and cannot be forced on one\footnote{Such
  self-consciousness does not impose itself upon anyone, and it does not simply occur
  without any assistance from us. One must actually act in a free manner, and then
  one must abstract from the object and attend only to oneself. No one can be forced
  to do this. ... this type of consciousness cannot be proven to anyone. Everyone
  must freely generate it within himself. (1:429)}
- The 'I' is a kind of *striving* (or becoming) rather than a being
- The 'I' is intelligible solely in and through itself\footnote{The nature of the
  intellect consists precisely in this immediate unity of being and seeing.
  Everything included within the intellect exists \emph{for} the intellect, and the
  intellect is \emph{for itself} everything that it is; only insofar as this is true
  is the intellect what it is, \emph{qua} intellect. (1:435)}
