    Classical German Idealism
</h1>

<!-- Overview -->
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p><p>A survey of “Classical” German Idealism, starting with Kant’s publication of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> in 1781 and concluding with the first part of Hegel’s <em>Science of Logic</em> in 1812. Figures discussed include Kant, Jacobi, Reinhold, Schulze, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The general theme of the course concerns the question, “How is inquiry into the nature of reality—i.e. metaphysics—possible?”. In asking this question we focus on four lines of thought prominent in German Idealism—viz. Spinozism, skepticism, self-consciousness, and the relationship between the senses and the intellect.</p></p>

<!-- Course Objectives -->
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>In completing this course students will (i) gain a basic grasp of the views of Immanuel Kant and his immediate German Idealist successors; (ii) learn how Kant’s thought was received in Germany into the early 19th century; (iii) understand the formation and early developemnt of the various views that are typically grouped under the moniker of post-Kantian “German Idealism”.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

    <!-- Jargon -->
    <h3>Jargon</h3>
    <p>It’s important to be on top of the technical terms used by philoso- phers. Please ask for clarification of terms in class. You can also consult Jim Pryor’s online “Philosophical Terms and Methods.”</p>

    <!-- Help -->
    <h3>Help with Writing</h3>
    <p><p>Papers should adhere to some consistent practice of footnoting and citation (Chicago, MLA, etc.). I don’t really mind which one you use as long as you are consistent. On writing a philosophy paper, there is no better on-line guide than Jim Pryor’s. Please <a href="http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html">consult it</a>. Hacker’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Reference-Diana-Hacker-dp-1319057446/dp/1319057446/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">A Writer’s Reference</a> is also extremely helpful. Useful online writing help may be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab at <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/</a>.</p>
