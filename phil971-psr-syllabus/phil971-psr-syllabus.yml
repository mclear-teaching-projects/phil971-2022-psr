# Front matter
title: 'The Principle of Sufficient Reason'

quote: 
- content: 'This rule for determining something with respect to its temporal sequence, however, is that in what precedes, the condition is to be encountered under which the occurrence always (i.e., necessarily) follows. Thus the principle of sufficient reason is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective cognition of appearances with regard to their relation in the successive series of time.'
  title: '*Critique of Pure Reason*'
  author: 'Immanuel Kant'

# Sections
overview: |
  The “Principle of Sufficient Reason” (PSR) says that everything has an explanation, sufficient ground, or sufficient reason. The PSR plays a major role in the philosophical thinking of many Modern philosophers, either as a crucial guiding principle in theory construction, or as something to be wholly rejected. Its unrestricted application also famously leads to some rather surprising conclusions, such as necessitarianism and substance monism. In this seminar we will look at formulations and utilizations of the principle from the 17th century to the present, as well as justifications for and against its application. A central aim of the course will be to understand Kant’s articulation and criticism of the PSR, as well as his attempt at justifying a more limited application of it. Another, more general, aim is that of putting figures from the (early) Modern tradition in dialogue with one another, as well as with contemporary philosophical work. Other than Kant, the primary figures discussed will be Spinoza, Leibniz, and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary work by philosophers such as Jonathan Bennett, Alex Pruss, Shamik Dasgupta, Sam Levey, and Michael Della Rocca. Other figures discussed may include Descartes, Hume, Jacobi, Fichte, and Hegel. Note that though a background in Modern philosophy is encouraged, it is not a requirement for the course.

objectives:
  - In completing this course students will (i) gain an understanding of the role that the PSR plays in the thought of a variety of philosophers in the Modern period; (ii) articulate the various problems and prospects offered by different formulations of the PSR; (iii) assess the ongoing viability (if any) that the PSR may still have.

  help: |
    Papers should adhere to some consistent practice of footnoting and citation (Chicago, MLA, etc.). I don’t really mind which one you use as long as you are consistent. On writing a philosophy paper, there is no better on-line guide than Jim Pryor’s. Please [consult it](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html). Hacker’s [A Writer’s Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Reference-Diana-Hacker-dp-1319057446/dp/1319057446/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) is also extremely helpful. Useful online writing help may be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab at [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/).
