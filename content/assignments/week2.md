This week we look at Spinoza&rsquo;s view of substance and its connection to one or another variety of the PSR. Among the questions we&rsquo;ll be asking are the following: Does Spinoza endorse a version of the PSR? What role, if any, does it play in his monism argument? How is any version of the PSR related to his overall project in _Ethics_ I? In what sense, if any, does Spinoza consider God/nature to be &ldquo;self-caused&rdquo;? How is his view of the causal-explanatory status of God different from that of Aquinas or Descartes?
