We continue with our discussion of Spinoza, focussing on his arguments in _Ethics_
II concerning the parallel structure of mind and body. One important question
raised here is how to understand the relationship between Spinoza&rsquo;s so-called
&ldquo;parallelism&rdquo; (or better: &ldquo;identity-theory&rdquo;) and his view of the intelligibility
of nature. Is his parallelism a result of his commitment to the intelligibility
of nature, or part of what drives that position?
