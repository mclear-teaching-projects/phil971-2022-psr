Last week we discussed the sense in which Kant thinks there is a legitimate theoretical application of the PSR, at least in a limited sense. This week we look at his discussion of reason, and of reason&rsquo;s _need_ for something like the PSR. Along with our guest, [Karl Schafer](https://philpeople.org/profiles/karl-schafer), we&rsquo;ll look at the sense in which the PSR functions as a &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; principle of our rational faculty, and further examine Kant&rsquo;s view concerning the legitimacy of its application.
