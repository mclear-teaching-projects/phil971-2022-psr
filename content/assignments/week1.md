This week we’ll go over the basic structure and themes of the course and then
turn to sketching the various things one might mean by the moniker "sufficient
reason". We'll briefly examine some pre-modern uses of the notion (though not
under that moniker as such) before turning to a sustained discussion of the sense
of the principle at work in Descartes's central arguments concerning God in the
_Meditations_.
