Welcome to PHIL 971! This week we'll discuss the structure and expectations for
the course, as well as work through some preliminary material regarding
different ways of thinking about metaphysical laws that might deserve the name
"principle of sufficient reason". We'll be asking about whether or not it is
right to think that there is _one_ canonical principle of sufficient reason, as
well as how notions of reason relate to those of ground, cause, explanation, and
intelligibility. We'll briefly examine some pre-modern uses of the notion
(though not under that moniker as such) before turning to a sustained discussion
of the sense of the principle at work in Descartes's central arguments
concerning God in the _Meditations_.
