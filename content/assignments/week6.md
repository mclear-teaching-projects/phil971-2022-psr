This week we look at Kant&rsquo;s discussion of the PSR and freedom in his 1755 _New Elucidation_, which was the first of two theses he wrote to become a professor at the University of Königsberg. In addition to discussing the PSR, particularly as it appears in the work of Leibniz and Wolff, Kant also discusses an alternative and broadly &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; conception of free will articulated by [Christian August Crusius](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/18thGerman-preKant/#ChriAuguCrus), whose essay I&rsquo;ve also included here.
