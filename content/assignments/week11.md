This week we will discuss a problem we&rsquo;ve been dealing with only obliquely thus
far, namely, whether commitment to an unrestricted application of the PSR
results in a position according to which one has to deny the existence of finite
beings. This is the so-called &ldquo;acosmism problem&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll look at a brief
statement of it by Maimon, who coined the term &ldquo;acosmism&rdquo;, as well as Hegel&rsquo;s
critical discussion of the problem as it arises (or so Hegel contends) in Spinoza&rsquo;s work.
