### Passage One {#passage-one}

Paremenides, _Fragment_ 8:

> for what coming-to-be of [being] will you seek?
> In what way, whence, did [it] grow? Neither from what-is-not shall I allow
> You to say or think; for it is not to be said or thought
> That [if] is not. And what need could have impelled it to grow
> Later or sooner, if it began from nothing?
> Thus [it] must either be completely or not at all.


### Passage Two {#passage-two}

Descartes, _Meditations_ III

> it is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as much
> [reality] in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause. For
> where, I ask, could the effect get its reality from, if not from the cause? And
> how could the cause give it to the effect unless it possessed it? It follows
> from this both that something cannot arise from nothing, and also that what is
> more perfect - that is, contains in itself more reality - cannot arise from what
> is less perfect. And this is transparently true not only in the case of effects
> which possess [what the school philosophers call] actual or formal reality, but
> also in the case of ideas, where one is considering only [what they call]
> objective reality (7:40-1).
