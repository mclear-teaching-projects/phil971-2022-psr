This week we look at Schopenhauer&rsquo;s early work (subsequently revised) on the principle (or principles) of sufficient reason. We&rsquo;ll see his revisions to Kant&rsquo;s own view, though he remains broadly sympathetic to Kant in comparison with his negative view of post-Kantian German Idealism.
