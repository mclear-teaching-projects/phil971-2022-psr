## <span class="section-num">1</span> Background {#background}

Bento (in Hebrew, Baruch; in Latin, Benedictus: all three names mean &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;)
[Spinoza](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/) (1632-1677) was born in Amsterdam and died in The Hague. He was born into a
community of Portuguese Jews that had settled in the city of Amsterdam in the wake of
the Portuguese Inquisition (1536), which had resulted in forced conversions and
expulsions from the Iberian peninsula. His father, Miguel de Espinoza, was a
successful, though not particularly wealthy, merchant.

Though Spinoza had a traditional and devout Jewish upbringing his relationship to
Judaism was complex, and he was ultimately excommunicated on 27 July 1656, from the
Jewish church, on the basis of his philosophical works (he was at this time only
23). While it is not exactly clear which doctrines in particular were the basis for
the excommunication, it would likely have been due to several doctrines that he
denied, including the immortality of the soul; the notion of a transcendent,
providential God---the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and that the Law was neither
literally given by God nor binding on Jews (see (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Nadler 2016</a>)).

The _Ethics_ was not published until after Spinoza died, in 1677, though there is some
evidence that it was ready to be published at least as early as 1675. Writing to his
friend Oldenberg Spinoza says,

> a rumor was spread everywhere that a book of mine about god was in the
> press, and that in it I strove to show that there is no God. Many
> people believed this rumor. So certain theologians-who had, perhaps,
> started the rumor themselves--seized this opportunityto complain about
> me to the Prince and the magistrates. Moreover, the stupid Cartesians,
> who are thought to favor me, would not stop trying to remove this
> suspicion from themselves by denouncing my opinions and writings
> everywhere. When I learned this from certain trustworthy men, who also
> told me the theologians were everywhere plotting against me, I decided
> to put off the publication I was planning until I saw how the matter
> would turn out. (Letter 68, IV/299; quoted in (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Curley 1994</a>))

Spinoza died about a year and a half after this---on 21 February, 1677---of a lung
disease that was possibly due to the dust of the lenses he had been grinding in order
to support himself. He was only 44. A few months later his friends arranged for the
publication of the _Ethics_, along with his correspondence and three other unfinished
works: the _Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect_, the _Political Treatise_, and a
_Hebrew Grammar_.

Since the _Ethics_ is an extraordinarily rich work, our discussion will not be adequate
to the topics it covers, nor the depth of detail that they warrant. Instead we will
look at just a few of the central arguments for each part of the _Ethics_. In this
first set of notes we look at just one of Book I&rsquo;s central arguments---the argument
that there is only one substance or thing and that this substance is God, understood as the
totality of nature.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> The Geometric Method {#the-geometric-method}

Before we turn to the arguments of the _Ethics_, it&rsquo;s worth commenting on the nature of
the method Spinoza follows in the overall argument of the _Ethics_. This method is what
is known as the &ldquo;geometric method&rdquo; in that it follows a form of presentation most
famously executed by Euclid in his _Elements_. It thus shares with that work a
presentation of argument in terms of definitions, axioms, propositions and
demonstrations. There are at least two important reasons for Spinoza&rsquo;s choice of the
geometric method for the presentation of his philosophy.

First, the method allows the reader to connect and cross-reference each demonstrated
proposition with earlier definitions, axioms, etc., from which it is derived. In this
it is meant to be a precise and logically well-grounded presentation of Spinoza&rsquo;s
views (though in actuality it is not always clear that Spinoza&rsquo;s conclusions follow
from the definitions and axioms to which he appeals). Second, the geometric method is
also meant to embody a kind of _development_ in the thinking of the reader; as the
reader moves through the various initial definitions, axioms, and demonstrations, the
activity of doing this manifests a kind of development in the reader&rsquo;s understanding
of the nature of things.

As with Euclid&rsquo;s _Elements_, Spinoza&rsquo;s _Ethics_ proceeds with seven kinds of claim:

Definitions
: meanings of key terms

Axioms
: basic, self-evident truths

Propositions
: the points that Spinoza explicitly argues for by means of &ldquo;demonstrations&rdquo;

Corollaries
: propositions that follow directly from the propositions they are appended to

Lemma
: propositions specifically for demonstrating truths related to some further
    proposition; Spinoza reserves them for propositions related to physical bodies (these appear only in Part II)

Postulates
: propositions that are assumed as true even if not self-evidently
    true; Spinoza uses these with respect to assumptions about the human body that are drawn from (and apparently, justitifed by) &ldquo;common experience&rdquo;

Scholia
: explanatory remarks on the propositions; these are some of the places
    where Spinoza engages in more informal explanation and elucidation
