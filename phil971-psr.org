This is the homepage for *PHIL 971* – Kant & The Principle of Sufficient Reason (*Fall 2022*)

The “Principle of Sufficient Reason” (PSR) says that everything has an explanation, sufficient ground, or sufficient reason. The PSR plays a major role in the philosophical thinking of many Modern philosophers, either as a crucial guiding principle in theory construction and the pursuit of scientific knowledge, or as something to be wholly rejected. Its unrestricted application also famously leads to some rather potentially surprising conclusions, such as necessitarianism and substance monism. In this seminar we will look at formulations and utilizations of the principle from the 17th century to the present, as well as justifications for and against its application. A central aim of the course will be to understand Kant’s articulation and criticism of the PSR, as well as his attempt at justifying a more limited application of it. Another, more general, aim is that of putting figures from the (early) Modern tradition in dialogue with one another, as well as with contemporary philosophical work. Other than Kant, the primary figures discussed will be Spinoza, Leibniz, and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary work by philosophers such as Jonathan Bennett, Alex Pruss, Shamik Dasgupta, Sam Levey, and Michael Della Rocca. Other figures discussed include Descartes, Hume, Jacobi, and Hegel. Note that though a background in Modern philosophy is encouraged, it is not a requirement for the course.

Welcome to PHIL 971! This week we'll discuss the structure and expectations for
the course, as well as work through some preliminary material regarding
different ways of thinking about metaphysical laws that might deserve the name
"principle of sufficient reason". We'll be asking about whether or not it is
right to think that there is /one/ canonical principle of sufficient reason, as
well as how notions of reason relate to those of ground, cause, explanation, and
intelligibility. We'll briefly examine some pre-modern uses of the notion
(though not under that moniker as such) before turning to a sustained discussion
of the sense of the principle at work in Descartes's central arguments
concerning God in the /Meditations/.

This week we look at Spinoza's view of substance and its connection to one or another variety of the PSR. Among the questions we'll be asking are the following: Does Spinoza endorse a version of the PSR? What role, if any, does it play in his monism argument? How is any version of the PSR related to his overall project in /Ethics/ I? In what sense, if any, does Spinoza consider God/nature to be "self-caused"? How is his view of the causal-explanatory status of God different from that of Aquinas or Descartes?

We continue with our discussion of Spinoza, focussing on his arguments in /Ethics/
II concerning the parallel structure of mind and body. One important question
raised here is how to understand the relationship between Spinoza's so-called
"parallelism" (or better: "identity-theory") and his view of the intelligibility
of nature. Is his parallelism a result of his commitment to the intelligibility
of nature, or part of what drives that position?

In this set of notes I discuss the origins of the PSR in Greek Antiquity, its development by Aquinas, and applications of it by Descartes. A central aim is to show different senses of the principle as well as its roots in explanation and theory generation.

Below are notes I use in undergraduate introductions to E2. I lay out some of the basic issues regarding Spinoza's view of the mind and the mind-body relation.[fn:1]

* Seminar Outlines
** Week 1
- [X] Introduce everyone
- [X] Go over syllabus
- [X] Go over guests and zoom meetings
- [X] Introduction to Material
- [X] Leibniz & PSR
- [X] Varieties of PSR
- [X] In what sense if any is PSR required for inquiry to be possible?
- [X] Is there a non-arbitrary way of restricting the PSR?

** Week 2
- [X] Brief review of last week
   + [X] Logical form & varieties of PSR
   + [X] Features of the "reason" or "ground" relation
      * transitive, asymmetric, and irreflexive?
   + [X] Does Descartes accept the standard form of ground relation?
      - [X] Is Descartes's conception of God as self-caused a problem for standard form?
   + [X] Does Descartes's view of universality of PSR_ontic indicate he endorses the universal intelligibility of all things?
- [X] Overview of Spinoza
   + [X] Geometric method
   + [X] Aims of the /Ethics/
      - [X] The nature of God, the relation of human being to God, and the conditions for a good human life
      - [X] Note that we won't in any sense discuss all (or even a majority) of the issues raised by the first two books
      - [X] Overview of E1-2
- [-] Spinoza on PSR & Substance
   + [X] Discuss defs & axioms
   + [ ] In what sense(s) does the PSR figure in Spinoza's argument in E1? Is it presupposed by the defs or axioms? Or is it supported/justified by them?
   + [ ] Are there differences in Spinoza's acceptance of PSR_ontic and Descartes's?
   + [ ] In what sense does Spinoza endorse complete intelligibility?
   + [ ] What is the causal relation?
   + [ ] What is it to be intelligible? 
*** Questions
- Seungchul:
   1) Do we need to assume determinism to understand E1a3?
   2) How to derive the claim (call this claim α) that from the order of Nature it must follow either that the triangle necessarily exists now or that it is impossible for it to exist now? and How to derive, from α, the claim that a thing necessarily exists if there is no reason or cause which prevents it from existing? 
- Eunhong: How can we—the mere modes— can infer the substance? I think that the only substance that can be discovered through modes is the substance as mode, not the substance ipso facto.
- Janelle: The question that I have is whether or not ideas can be limited by bodies given A6
- Kendric:
   1) Is a mode an infinite collection of things (e.g. a mode of extension that infinitely spans time and all of space) or is an infinite mode supposed to be shorthand for an infinite series or "package" of modes?
   2) It seems that, when wielding the PSR, one can only reasonably come up with a direct, one-hop, connection between things or a collection of infinitely many things. Restricted this way, will this be able to solve our metaphysical needs?
   3) Why is MDR so good?
- Jessica:
   1) how do we as a reader and the author define “its own kind” in reference to infinite and finite?
   2) A physical thing can not exist correct but can we as the reader use the definition of essence or the word to apply to a non-physical thing that can exist (ex; thoughts and ideas)?
   3) how are we defining substance and it’s attributes? If no two substances can share an attribute why can God contain all attributes but can still only be considered one substance??
- Jack:
   1) it doesn’t seem possible to have a positive conception of God (at least not in the sense that we can have a positive conception of the aforementioned examples). And so it looks like Not-wide is the only natural thing to say.
- Youmin:
   1) Descartes talks about the differences in where attributes are involved in things or thoughts. It seems he tries to give an example from the difference between time and duration which distinction is in thought. However, I can't get the connection between this distinction, the explanation of some attributes originated from though, and the theory of sufficient reason of fact.
   2) other paragraphs of Descartes seem to try to distinguish attributes that are involved in a thing or a thought. Then, how this distinction is connected to the ground of the fact? Is the way of being the same as the reason for being (or fact)?
- Il-Hwan:
   1) P5 & P8 are problematic
- Victor:
   1) Problems w/P28
       1) in what capacity is God the cause of the existence of finite things at all (since their finite existence does not follow from his absolute nature) and, even more importantly
       2) in what sense is then their existence necessary (since they seem to necessarily follow from each other within the realm of natura naturata)?
