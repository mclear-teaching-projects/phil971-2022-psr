This is the homepage for *PHIL 971* – Kant & The Principle of Sufficient Reason (*Fall 2022*)

The “Principle of Sufficient Reason” (PSR) says that everything has an explanation, sufficient ground, or sufficient reason. The PSR plays a major role in the philosophical thinking of many Modern philosophers, either as a crucial guiding principle in theory construction and the pursuit of scientific knowledge, or as something to be wholly rejected. Its unrestricted application also famously leads to some rather potentially surprising conclusions, such as necessitarianism and substance monism. In this seminar we will look at formulations and utilizations of the principle from the 17th century to the present, as well as justifications for and against its application. A central aim of the course will be to understand Kant’s articulation and criticism of the PSR, as well as his attempt at justifying a more limited application of it. Another, more general, aim is that of putting figures from the (early) Modern tradition in dialogue with one another, as well as with contemporary philosophical work. Other than Kant, the primary figures discussed will be Spinoza, Leibniz, and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary work by philosophers such as Jonathan Bennett, Alex Pruss, Shamik Dasgupta, Sam Levey, and Michael Della Rocca. Other figures discussed include Descartes, Hume, Jacobi, and Hegel. Note that though a background in Modern philosophy is encouraged, it is not a requirement for the course.

Here are some possible topics for papers. You are welcome to write on something else (or on some modified topic related to one of the options below), but please discuss this with me first. The first draft of the paper is due *Friday, November 18th*. The final draft is due *Friday, December 8th*.

1. In what sense is it wrong to say that there is a single principle of sufficient reason? Explain how different forms of the principle might be different or related. In what sense to any of the historical figures we've discussed accept or reject various versions of "the" principle? 
2. Explain the sense in which Descartes thinks God is its own efficient cause. In what way is this controversial? Is Descartes's position plausible?
3. How is any version of the PSR related to Spinoza's overall project in Ethics I-II?
4. In what sense, if any, does Spinoza consider God/nature to be “self-caused”? How is his view of the causal-explanatory status of God different from that of Aquinas or Descartes?
5. Explain Spinoza's "parallelism" doctrine. Is his parallelism a result of his commitment to the intelligibility of nature, or part of what drives that position?
6. What version of "the" PSR does Leibniz accept. Does Leibniz give a justification for the PSR? If so is it successful?
7. Explain Leibniz's conception of freedom. What is Arnauld's objection? Does Leibniz offer a convincing reply? Why or why not?
8. Explain Crusius's conception of freedom and Kant's objections. What role does the PSR play in each of their positions? Whose position is the more convincing one?
9. Explain Kant's argument that God is not its own cause or ground. Does Kant think there is an explanation of God's existence, or the existence of anything at all? Explain and defend your answers. 
10. In what sense does Kant's theory of phenomenal causality count as endorsing the PSR (or a version thereof)? Is this endorsement limited or qualified in any particular way? Is Kant's position here plausible/well-grounded?   
11. Della Rocca contends that attempts to accept the PSR but limit it are always going to be unsuccessful. Explain his argument here. Does Dasgupta have any resources to reply? What about historical figures such as Kant? If Della Rocca is right what is the upshot of his view?

Welcome to PHIL 971! This week we'll discuss the structure and expectations for
the course, as well as work through some preliminary material regarding
different ways of thinking about metaphysical laws that might deserve the name
"principle of sufficient reason". We'll be asking about whether or not it is
right to think that there is /one/ canonical principle of sufficient reason, as
well as how notions of reason relate to those of ground, cause, explanation, and
intelligibility. We'll briefly examine some pre-modern uses of the notion
(though not under that moniker as such) before turning to a sustained discussion
of the sense of the principle at work in Descartes's central arguments
concerning God in the /Meditations/.

This week we look at Spinoza's view of substance and its connection to one or another variety of the PSR. Among the questions we'll be asking are the following: Does Spinoza endorse a version of the PSR? What role, if any, does it play in his monism argument? How is any version of the PSR related to his overall project in /Ethics/ I? In what sense, if any, does Spinoza consider God/nature to be "self-caused"? How is his view of the causal-explanatory status of God different from that of Aquinas or Descartes?

We continue with our discussion of Spinoza, focussing on his arguments in /Ethics/
II concerning the parallel structure of mind and body. One important question
raised here is how to understand the relationship between Spinoza's so-called
"parallelism" (or better: "identity-theory") and his view of the intelligibility
of nature. Is his parallelism a result of his commitment to the intelligibility
of nature, or part of what drives that position?

This week we look at Kant's discussion of the PSR and freedom in his 1755 /New Elucidation/, which was the first of two theses he wrote to become a professor at the University of Königsberg. In addition to discussing the PSR, particularly as it appears in the work of Leibniz and Wolff, Kant also discusses an alternative and broadly "libertarian" conception of free will articulated by [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/18thGerman-preKant/#ChriAuguCrus][Christian August Crusius]], whose essay I've also included here.

**** Passage One

Paremenides, /Fragment/ 8:

#+begin_quote
for what coming-to-be of [being] will you seek?
In what way, whence, did [it] grow? Neither from what-is-not shall I allow
You to say or think; for it is not to be said or thought
That [if] is not. And what need could have impelled it to grow
Later or sooner, if it began from nothing?
Thus [it] must either be completely or not at all.
#+end_quote

**** Passage Two

Descartes, /Meditations/ III

#+begin_quote
it is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as much
[reality] in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause. For
where, I ask, could the effect get its reality from, if not from the cause? And
how could the cause give it to the effect unless it possessed it? It follows
from this both that something cannot arise from nothing, and also that what is
more perfect - that is, contains in itself more reality - cannot arise from what
is less perfect. And this is transparently true not only in the case of effects
which possess [what the school philosophers call] actual or formal reality, but
also in the case of ideas, where one is considering only [what they call]
objective reality (7:40-1).

*** DONE Week 7 – Kant II: The PSR & Ontotheology (Guest: Dai Heide)

This week we discuss Kant's arguments concerning existence, possibility, and God. We'll see that though Kant denies that God's existence is something that admits of an explanation, in the manner that contingent things admit of explanation, nevertheless we can be certain of God's existence because God is the ground of all possibility. However, one crucial aspect of Kant's argument continues to cause interpreters trouble---namely, how he understands the nature of =<existence>= as term or predicate (and correspondingly as a property), and how his understanding of =<existence>= figures in his criticism of the ontological argument. We'll center this question through discussion of Kant's /Only Possible Argument/ essay of 1763 and a recent paper by [[https://sites.google.com/view/daiheide/][Dai Heide]] (who will be our guest in seminar) that elucidates and defends Kant's position on this issue. 

Note that the Bennett and the initial sections of the Van Cleve readings in the recommended reading list give relevant background for the view Heide discusses in his paper.

Thus far we've looked at Kant's pre-critical view of ground, the PSR, and its
legitimate scope. This week we'll discuss Kant's critical view regarding
temporal succession and causal determination and examine the sense in which this
counts as endorsing a version of the PSR.

**** Leibniz -- Chronology 

Here's a brief overview of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's life (1646–1716). For
further details see his [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/][SEP entry]].

- Born in Leipzig in 1646, trained as a lawyer and defended his degree
  in law at, 20 in Altdorf in 1666.
- Lived in Paris from 1672-6 where he received much of his training in
  mathematics and physics, and independently from Newton invented the
  differential and integral calculus
- Appointed court councilor at Braunschweig-Lüneberg in Hanover in 1667
   - While only publishing one book in his lifetime (the 1710 /Theodicy/) he wrote
     many important shorter works (e.g. 1684's /Meditations on Knowledge, Truth,
     and Ideas/, 1686's /Discourse on Metaphysics/, 1695's /New System/, and
     1714's /Monadology/)
- Died in Hanover on November 14, 1716
- Some (near) contemporaries:
   - Descartes (1596-1650)
   - Malebranche (1638-1715)
   - Thomas Reid (1710-1796)
   - Christian Wolff (1679–1754) 
   - Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

**** The Metaphysics of Substance 
All of the leading philosophers of the seventeenth century begin from the idea
that the most basic kind of being, in terms of which all else is to be
explained, is substance. This means that substance must be, in an appropriate
sense, causally and explanatorily self-sufficient. Sometimes this is put
in terms of predication. Substances are the ultimate subjects of predication,
which is to say that we predicate things of substances (e.g. 'The stone is
cold', 'John is tall') and never predicate substances of anything else.
Substances thus constitute the basic 'furniture' of reality.

I discuss Leibniz's position on freedom and contingency. It is important for Leibniz that his view allow for the ability to do otherwise, or leeway in action, that we take to be exemplified in saying of some act that it was possible for it not to be done (or the event not to occur, etc.). Thus, though Liebniz accepts a seemingly unrestricted form of the PSR, he does not want to accept the kind of so-called "necessitarian" position of Spinoza. The question is whether Leibniz succeeds in doing so.

**** Complete Individual Concepts

In §8 of his /Discourse on Metaphysics/ Leibniz says the following:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
since activity and passivity pertain distinctively to individual substances (/actiones sum suppositorum/), it will be necessary to explain what such a substance is. It is of course true that when a number of predicates are attributed to a single subject while this subject is not attributed to any other, it is called an individual substance. But this is not enough, and such a definition is merely nominal. We must consider, then, what it means to be truly attributed to a certain subject. Now it is certain that every true predication has some basis in the nature of things, and when a proposition is not an identity, that is to say, when the predicate is not expressly contained in the subject, it must be included in it virtually. This is what the philosophers call in-esse, when they say that the predicate is in the subject. So the subject term must always include the predicate term in such a way that anyone who understands perfectly the concept of the subject will also know that the predicate pertains to it. This being premised, we can say it is the nature of an individual substance or complete being to have a concept so complete that it is sufficient to make us understand and deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which the concept is attributed. An accident, on the other hand, is a being whose concept does not include everything that can be attributed to the subject to which the concept is attributed. Thus the quality of king which belonged to Alexander the Great, if we abstract it from its subject, is not determined enough to define an individual, for it does not include the other qualities of the same subject or everything which the concept of this prince includes. God, on the contrary, in seeing the individual notion or 'haecceity' of Alexander, sees in it at the same time the basis and the reason for all the predicates which can truly be affirmed of him -for example, that he will conquer Darius and Porus- even knowing a priori (and not by experience) what we can know only through history - whether he died a natural death or by poison. Thus when we well consider the connection of things, it can be said that there are at all times in the soul of Alexander traces of all that has happened to him and marks of all that will happen to him and even traces of all that happens in the universe, though it belongs only to God to know them all [cite:@leibniz1969f pp. 307-8].
#+END_QUOTE

1. What is a "complete individual concept"?
2. What is the relation between a complete concept and the substance whose concept it is?
3. In what sense does Leibniz's theory of complete individual concepts threaten free will?

Leibniz states this threat very clearly at the beginning of §13 of the
/Discourse/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
before we go further we must try to meet a great difficulty which may grow out of the foundations which we have laid above. We have said that the concept of an individual substance once and for all includes everything which can ever happen to it and that in considering that concept, one can see everything which can truly be predicated of it, just as we can see in the essence of the circle all the properties which can be deduced from it. But it seems that this will destroy the distinction between contingent and necessary truths, that it will leave no place for human liberty, and that an absolute fatalism will rule over all our actions as well as over the other events of the world. To this I reply that we must distinguish between what is certain and what is necessary [cite:@leibniz1969f p. 310].
#+END_QUOTE

1. What is the point of the distinction here between what is "certain" and what is "necessary"? 

**** Freedom of Choice

Here is how Leibniz characterizes the contingent and necessary, so as to make room for free will:

#+begin_QUOTE
I say that whatever happens in conformity to these divine anticipations is assured but not necessary and that if anyone were to do the contrary, he would not do anything impossible in itself, though it would be impossible /ex hypothesi/ for it to happen. For if some man were able to carry out the complete demonstration by virtue of which he could prove this connection between the subject, who is Caesar, and the predicate, which is his successful undertaking, he would actually show that the future dictatorship of Caesar is based in his concept or nature and that there is a reason in that concept why he has resolved to cross the Rubicon rather than stop there, and why he has won rather than lost the day at Pharsalus, and why it was reasonable and consequently assured that this should happen. But this man could not show that these events are necessary in themselves or that their contrary implies a contradiction. In the same way it is reasonable and assured that God will always do what is best, even though what is less perfect implies no contradiction. For it will be found that this demonstration of the predicate of Caesar is not as absolute as that of numbers or of geometry but that it supposes the sequence of things which God has freely chosen and which is founded on the first free decree of God, which leads him always to do what is most perfect, and on the decree which God has made about human nature (following the primary one), which is that man shall always do, though freely, that which appears to him to be best. But every truth which is based on this kind of a decree is contingent, even though it is certain, for these decrees do not change the possibility of things. And as I have already said, though God assuredly always chooses the best, this does not prevent something less perfect from being and remaining possible in itself, even though it will never happen, for it is not its impossibility but its imperfection which causes God to reject it. Now nothing is necessary whose opposite is possible [cite:@leibniz1969f p. 311].
#+END_QUOTE

1. How does Leibniz characterize necessity? Contingency?
2. What is the difference between absolute and hypothetical necessity?
3. In what sense does God act freely in creating the world?
4. Why is God's free act of creation relevant to the freedom of human action?


Leibniz also contends that completely undetermined action is not itself free action.

#+begin_quote
If complete indifference is required for freedom, then there is scarcely ever a free act [cite:@leibniz1989 pp. 22-3].
#+end_quote

1. Why might indifference be required for freedom?
2. In what sense (if any) does Leibniz think that every action is determined (or has a determining ground), and so fail to be "indifferent"?


Perhaps most controversially then -- Leibniz considers free action and determined action to be in a certain sense perfectly compatible, and indeed, synonymous.

#+begin_quote
a reason that always forces a free mind to choose one thing over another (whether that reason derives from the perfection of a thing, as it does in God, or from our imperfection) does not eliminate our freedom [cite:@leibniz1989 p. 20].

**** Crusius On Ground
Crusius contends that there are two general species of ground -- *ideal* and *real*.

#+begin_quote
what one calls grounded and whose production [dessen hervorbringen] one attributes to another is either cognition in the understanding or it is the thing itself, outside of our thoughts. For that reason a ground is either a ground of cognition, which can also be called an ideal ground (/principium cognoscendi/), or a real ground (/principium essendi vel fiendi/). A ground of cognition is one that brings about cognition of a matter with conviction and is viewed as such. A real ground is one that brings about or makes possible, either in part or in whole, the thing itself, outside of our thoughts. (/Entwurf/ §34/144)
#+end_quote

Real grounds themselves come in two further types, *efficacious* and *inefficacious* (existential):

#+begin_quote
When a *real ground* brings about or makes possible a thing outside of thought, it does so either by means of an efficacious power and, in that case, is called an *efficacious cause* [wirkende Ursache]. Or the laws of truth in general do not allow anything else other than that after certain things or certain of its properties have already been posited, something else is now possible or impossible, or must be possible in this way and not otherwise. This kind of ground I wish to call an *inefficacious real ground* or also an *existential ground* (/principium existentialiter determinans/). Accordingly, an existential ground is one that makes something else possible or necessary through its mere existence due to the laws of truth. E.g., the three sides of a triangle and their relations to each other constitute a real ground of the size of its angle, but only an inefficacious or existential ground. By contrast, fire is an efficacious cause of warmth. (/Entwurf/ §36/144)
#+end_quote

- Are all forms of ground productive? If so in what sense? Are they all productive in the same way?
- Are efficient grounds causal in any sense? 

***** Crusisu on Intelligibility 
Importantly, Crusius denies that "ground", as such, should be taken to indicate or entail intelligibility of the ground-grounded relation.

#+begin_quote
Some take the word *ground* in a narrower sense and understand by it something from which one can comprehend why something else exists and why it is such and not otherwise. Now when we pay attention to what we think with the word *why*, it is clear in that case that only *both senses of real grounds* [i.e., /a priori/ and /a posteriori/ ] along with *ideal grounds* /a priori/ are to be counted as falling under the concept of ground. By contrast, when we attend to ideal grounds /a posteriori/, we find that we do not thereby cognize *why something exists*, but rather only *why we must let it be considered to be true*. (/Entwurf/ §38/144-5)
#+end_quote

- What is the difference between a ground of truth and a ground of existence? 

***** Sufficient vs Determining Grounds

Grounds may also be sufficient or determining. A /determining ground/ is that which produces a determination. As Crusius puts it,

#+begin_quote
a *determining ground* is one through which what is grounded in it is made actual or possible in such a way that it cannot be otherwise under these circumstances (/Entwurf/ §84/160)
#+end_quote

Crusius contends that while all existing contingent things have a sufficient ground or cause of their existence, not all existing contingent things a /determining/ ground or cause of their existence. He says,

#+begin_quote
everything that arises presupposes a sufficient cause, that is, a cause in which nothing is lacking that is necessary for causality, and that it must receive its actuality through the power of the cause (§31), and the distinguishing feature of whether something is contingent, and thus arose at one time, consists in whether its non-being can be thought (§33). (/Entwurf/ §84/160)
#+end_quote

- What is the difference here that Crusius means to indicate?
- Is the difference between a merely sufficient cause and a determining ground coherent? 

Crusius thus defines the "principle of determining ground" as follows:

#+begin_quote
we can define the true *principle of determining ground*, which must be as follows: *Everything that is not a fundamental activity of freedom has, when it arises, a determining ground, that is, a ground according to which, after it is posited, what it posits cannot be or occur otherwise*. (/Entwurf/ §84/161)
#+end_quote

**** Kant on Ground

Kant's definition of ground:

#+begin_quote
That which determines a subject in respect of any of its predicates, is called the /ground/. (NE 1:391)
#+end_quote

Alternatively,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
From the concept of a ground it is possible to understand which of the opposed predicates is to be ascribed to the subject and which is to be denied. (1:393)
#+END_QUOTE

***** Logical vs. Real Ground

Kant also distinguishes between a logical ground and a real ground.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Every ground is either logical, by means of which the consequence that is identical to it is posited as a predicate according to the rule of identity, or real, by means of which the consequence that is not identical to it is not posited according to the rule of identity. (/Metaphysik Herder/ (1762-4), 28:11)
#+END_QUOTE

This characterization of ground is virtually identical with Crusius's conception of the difference between ideal and real grounds. Both take "ground" to indicate a necessary relation between (possibly) existing objects or facts. The sense in which a ground "determines" is that it being posited excludes all but one consequence. So positing ground \gamma excludes all but the consequent \delta.

***** Antecendent & Consequent Grounds

In the pre-critical period Kant distinguishes two kinds of ground or reason -- viz. 'antecedently' (/antecedenter/) and 'consequently' (/consequenter/) determining grounds.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That which determines a subject in respect of any of its predicates, is called the /ground/. /Grounds/ may be differentiated into those which are antecedently determining and those which are consequentially determining. An /antecedently/ determining ground is one, the concept of which precedes that which is determined, i.e. that in the absence of which what is determined would not be intelligible. A /consequentially/ determining ground is one which would not be posited [poneretur] unless the concept which is determined by it had not already been posited from some other source. You can also call the former the reason /why/, or the ground of being or becoming [rationem cur scilicet essendi vel fiendi], while the latter can be called the ground /that/, or the ground of knowing [rationem quod scilicet cognoscendi] (NE 1:391-2)
#+END_QUOTE

Only antecedently determining grounds explain why their consequents hold. 

***** Ground & Exclusion 
What is meant by "exclusion" in reference to ground? Consider Kant's remark in a letter to Reinhold during the "critical" period.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A ground is (in general) that whereby something else (distinct from it) is made determinate {/quo posito *determinate^{a}* ponitur aliud/) [that which being posited /determines something else/]. A consequent (/rationatum/) is /quod non ponitur nisi posito alio/ [that which is not posited unless /something else/ is posited]. The ground must thus always be something distinct from the consequent, and he who can provide no ground but the given consequent itself shows that he does not know (or that the thing does not have) any ground! Now this distinction of ground and consequent is either merely logical (having to do with the manner of representation) or real, that is, in the object itself. (11:35 To Karl Leonhard Reinhold. May 12, 1789)

/a/: This expression must never be left out of the definition of "ground." For a consequent too, is something that, if I posit it, I must at the same time think something else as posited, that is, a consequent always belongs to something or other that is its ground. But when I think something as consequent, I posit only some ground or other; -which ground is undetermined. (Thus the hypothetical judgment is based on the rule, "a positione consequentis ad positionem antecedentis non valet consequentia" [the movement from the consequent to the antecedent is not valid].) On the other hand, if the ground is posited, the consequent is determined.
#+END_QUOTE

Since there is real and logical ground, there are real and logical forms of exclusion or "opposition":

#+begin_quote
Real opposition is that where two predicates of a thing are opposed to each other, but not through the law of contradiction. Here, too, one cancels what is posited by the other, but the consequence is something. The motive force of a body in one direction and an equal tendency of the same body in the opposite direction do not contradict each other; as predicates, they are simultaneously possible in one body. The consequence of such an opposition is rest, which is something. It is, nonetheless, a true opposition. For that which is posited by the one tendency is cancelled by the other tendency, and the two tendencies are true predicates of one and the self-same thing, and they belong to it simultaneously. (NM 2:171-2)
#+end_quote

Hence, forces can exclude one another through opposition, but the opposition appealed to here is not that of /contradiction/. One piece of evidence Kant offers for this is that opposing (i.e. contradictory) predicates cannot be combined in a unity---i.e. in a judgment (A150/B189-90)---while opposing forces /can/ be combined in a unity (i.e. in a substance). Kant's example in the latter case is a stationary being that is so because of the outcome of being acted on by an opposing force.

So determination is the exclusion of a predicate or property in favor of its opposite. What "opposite" means here depends on the kind of law to which one appeals. In the case of /logical/ determination, the exclusion is defined in terms of logically opposing predicates. In the case of /real/ determination, the exclusion is defined merely negatively, in terms of predicates that oppose though not logically.

The exclusion doctrine is thus one according to which a ground determines by virtue of:

1. the predicate/property
2. the law governing the connection between positing that predicate and positing
   its consequent.

The difference between the pre-critical and critical versions of this doctrine concern the different between whether there are real grounds that are not logical grounds. 


**** Kant's Compatibilism
Kant holds in the 1750s and 60s that freedom of action is perfectly compatible with its being fully (temporally) determined. As Kant puts it in the /New Elucidation/ of 1755,

#+begin_quote
/spontaneity/ is action which issues from an /inner principle/. /When this spontaneity is determined in conformity with the representation of what is best it is called freedom/ (NE 1:402; original emphasis)
#+end_quote

However, Kant also rejects an important element of the Leibniz-Wolff-Baumgarten view, namely its leeway compatibilist aspect, which holds that while an agent is free only insofar as the agent could do otherwise, the notion of "could" here must be compatible with necessitation by a sufficient reason or ground. Kant denies that the Leibniz-Wolff-Baumgarten view can maintain a coherent conception of such leeway by means of a distinction between so-called "hypothetical" and "absolute" necessity (1:400). Kant cites Crusius as originating this critique.

#+begin_quote
The illustrious Crusius attacks the often used distinction between absolute and hypothetical necessity, his opponents thinking that, by means of this distinction, they would be able to escape him, as through a crack. But the distinction obviously has no power at all to break the force and effective power of necessity (NE 1:399)
#+end_quote

The distinction to which Kant refers here is that between \phi-ing on the basis of a particular contingent motive, and \phi-ing due to logical necessity. The former is mere "hypothetical" necessity, and allows that one could have acted otherwise (i.e. there is no logical contradiction in not acting that way) had one's motives differed, while the latter is an "absolute" necessity.

As Kant, following Crusius, argues however, this is a distinction without a difference, for

#+begin_quote
the distinction, which everyone recites parrot-fashion, does little to diminish the force of the necessity or the certainty of the determination. For just as nothing can be conceived which is more true than true, and nothing more certain than certain, so nothing can be conceived which is more determined than determined (NE 1:400).
#+end_quote

For Kant, the problem for freedom does not lie with whether one possesses leeway, nor is the issue one concerning necessitation (whether absolute or hypothetical) per se, but rather the /nature/ of the necessitation. As he puts it,

#+begin_quote
here the question hinges not upon /to what extent/ [somthing is necessitated] but upon /whence/ [unde] the necessary futurition of contingent things derives. Who is there who would doubt that the act of creation is not indeterminate in God, but that it is so certainly determinate that the opposite would be unworthy of God, in other words that the opposite could not be ascribed to Him at all. Nonetheless, however, the action is free, for it is determined by those grounds, which, in so far as they incline His will with the greatest possible certainty, include the motives of His infinite intelligence, and do not issue from a certain blind power of nature to produce effects. So, too, in the case of the free actions of human beings: in so far as they are regarded as determinate, their opposites are indeed excluded; they are not, however, excluded by grounds which are posited as existing outside the desires and spontaneous inclinations of the subject, as if the agent were compelled to perform his actions against his will, so to speak, and as a result of a certain ineluctable necessity. (NE 1:400)
#+end_quote

In short, Kant points out here that although everything that exists is determined, not everything is determined in the same /way/, and it is precisely the manner in which (i.e. "from whence") a consequence is derived or connected to its ground that decides the issue in favor of freedom as opposed to bondage. When the existence of an effect is determined from an intellectual ground, one that involves a representation of the good, then the effect is determined but nevertheless free, or so Kant contends.

***** The Luck Objection to Libertarianism 
Kant rejects Crusian indeterminism on the grounds that it must construe free action as "the product of chance" (NE 1:402), and chance events are neither free nor freedom-enabling. Since they have no cause they simply happen, and are not appropriate objects for imputation. Kant makes this point in his dialogical presentation of his and Crusius's views:

#+begin_quote
If any deity granted you this wish [for libertarian freedom], how unhappy you would be at every moment of your life. Suppose that you have decided to follow the path of virtue. And suppose that your mind is already sustained by the precepts of religion and whatever else is effective in strengthening your motivation. And suppose that now the occasion for acting arrives. You will immediately slide in the direction of what is less good, for the grounds which solicit you do not determine you. I seem to hear you expressing still more complaints. Ah! What baleful fate has driven me from my sound decision? Of what use are precepts for performing the work of virtue? Actions are the product of chance; they are not determined by grounds. (NE 1:402)
#+end_quote

To summarize, Kant's pre-critical position on freedom accepts the following claims:

1. Free action is compatible with being determined/necessitated to so act.
2. Action that is not the result of determination is merely chance.
3. Leeway is neither necessary nor sufficient for responsibility/imputation.
4. The determination of free action must be "spontaneous", in that it is necessitated according to the will's own (causal) law of activity in representing the good, otherwise it is either "blind" necessity (i.e. "fatalism") or chance.


By at least the mid-70s, Kant sees freedom as a "third thing" between temporal necessitation and pure chance. The question is whether, and in what sense, his compatibilist view from the 50s is rejected. 

#+begin_quote
Free actions happen in accordance with a rule just like natural ones. But they are not therefore determinable a priori [i.e. from the antecedent time] like the latter [sie sind darnach nicht a priori zu bestimmen wie diese]; both are thus in conformity with reason, while blind fate and blind chance [blind Schiksal und blindes Ohngefehr] are /qualitates occultae/ and are contrary to reason (R4783, 17:726 (1775--1779)).

**** Background

***** The aims of the Analytic of Principles:

1. Which concepts are a priori? (the Metaphysical Deduction)
2. Must the categories apply to objects of experience? (the Transcendental Deduction)
3. How could the categories apply to objects of experience? (the Schematism)
4. What synthetic a priori truths do we know as the result of their application? (the System of All Principles)

***** Schematism & Time

#+begin_quote
In all subsumptions of an object under a concept the representations of the former must be *homogeneous* with the latter, i.e., the concept must contain that which is represented in the object that is to be subsumed under it, for that is just what is meant by the expression "an object is contained under a concept". (A137/B176)
#+end_quote

- Homogeneity :: Two representations(?) X and Y are (partially) homogeneous iff
  X and Y share (some of) the same content.
  
The Homogeneity requirement raises a specific problem for the pure categories. It must be shown how the categories, whose content is purely a priori, and based on the logical (and thus non-sensory) functions of judgment, apply to object of experience, given that they are not homogenous with the objects of intuition.

- Kant requires an intermediary that is homogeneous with both the categories and appearances, as well as being
      – /universal/: applies to all appearances
      – /knowable a priori/: allows for knowledge of the a priori applicability of the categories to appearances
      – /diverse/: compatible with the full variety of logical properties and relations specified by the categories
- Only the representation of time and temporal relations satisfies all three conditions

#+begin_quote
The schemata are therefore nothing but a priori *time-determinations* in accordance with rules, and these concern, according to the order of the categories, the *time-series* [categories of quantity], the *content of time* [categories of quality], the *order of time* [categories of relation], and finally the *sum total of time* [categories of modality] in regard to all possible objects. (A145/B184-5)
#+end_quote



**** The Analogies

- The chapter called "The Analogies of Experience" concerns those principles that ground cognition through the application of the categories of relation (i.e. =<subsistence-inherence>=, =<cause-effect>=, =<community>=)

***** What is an “analogy”? 

Kant makes two explicit claims about the nature of analogies. He says,

#+begin_quote
[An analogy is] not the identity of two *quantitative* [relations, as in mathematical analogy] but [the identity] of two *qualitative* relations, where from three given members I can cognize and give a priori only the relation to a fourth member but not this fourth member itself, although I have a rule for seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there (B222)
#+end_quote

- Analogy :: of the form "A:B :: C:D", where "D" refers to something that is not cognizable a priori, though what is designated by "A", "B", "C", and the relevant relations /are/ so cognizable.


An "analogy of experience" is, 

#+begin_quote
An analogy of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the objects (of the appearances) *constitutively* but merely *regulatively*. (B222)
#+end_quote

This would seem to indicate that the relevant relata of the analogy are perceptions (or the appearances of objects of experience), and the relation is one that is set out by a specific rule. These rules are (here taking only the second edition of 1787 into consideration):

1. Principle of the persistence of substance: In all change of appearances substance persists, and its quantum is neither increased nor diminished in nature (B224)
2. Principle of temporal sequence according to the law of causality: All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause and effect (B232)
3. Principle of simultaneity, according to the law of interaction, or community: All substances, insofar as they can be perceived in space as simultaneous, are in thoroughgoing interaction (B256)

Kant thus distinguishes three different kinds of temporality (B219) present in the relational categories: persistence, succession, and simultaneity. He then claims that each kind of temporality is connected with each of the relational categories (i.e. persistence with =<substance-inherence>=, succession with =<cause-effect>=, and simultaneity with =<community>=).  

***** Are the analogies making epistemic or metaphysical claims?

- Time (qua form) or temporal properties may be directly perceived (A176/B219). Time and its properties are only representable analogically

#+begin_quote
we ... represent the temporal sequence through a line progressing to infinity, in which the manifold constitutes a series that is of only one dimension, and infer from the properties of this line to all the properties of time, with the sole difference that the parts of the former are simultaneous but those of the latter always exist successively. (A33/B50)
#+end_quote

- Time also necessitates. Given two temporal regions, A and B, A stands as a sufficient condition of B's occurrence (or the occurrence of a temporal series of which B is a member) just by virtue of occurring before B (i.e. standing in the =<earlier than>= relation). This is due solely to specific topological facts about time---that it is a single dimensional serial order of situation that is continuous and connected.
- Give that we cannot perceive time, there are likely to be epistemological issues with respect to making knowledge claims about it. But given that time has particular metaphysical features, it is also likely to play some sort of metaphysical or explanatory role as well. 


***** The Epistemological Argument in the Second Analogy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That something happens, i.e., that something or a state comes to be that previously was not, cannot be empirically perceived except where an appearance precedes that does not contain this state in itself; for a reality that would follow on an empty time, thus an arising not preceded by any state of things, can be apprehended just as little as empty time itself. Every apprehension of an occurrence is therefore a perception that follows another one. Since this is the case in all synthesis of apprehension, however, as I have shown above in the case of the appearance of a house, the apprehension of an occurrence is not yet thereby distinguished from any other. Yet I also note that, if in the case of an appearance that contains a happening I call the preceding state of perception A and the following one B, then B can only follow A in apprehension, but the perception A cannot follow but only precede B. E.g., I see a ship driven downstream. My perception of its position downstream follows the perception of its position upstream, and it is impossible that in the apprehension of this appearance the ship should first be perceived downstream and afterwards upstream. The order in the sequence of the perceptions in apprehension is therefore here determined, and the apprehension is bound to it. (A191-2/B236-7)
#+END_QUOTE


1. We cannot know by experience that an event---that is, a transition from a
   state A to a state B---is occurring by knowing that the perceptions of A and
   B occur in the order A, B; by knowing that the perceptions of A and B are
   irreversible; by knowing that A precedes B by reference to absolute time; or
   by knowing that these perceptions are of successive states of
   things-in-themselves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can know by experience that an event---that is,
   a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing that B
   follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can know by experience that an event---that is, a
   transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing that B
   follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause, then any
   event such that we can know of its occurrence by experience must have a
   cause.
4. \therefore Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by experience must have a
   cause.


***** Metaphysical Considerations
Kant remarks in the introduction to the discussion of the principles that,

#+begin_quote
[t]he conditions of the *possibility of experience* in general are at the same time conditions of the *possibility of the objects of experience*, and on this account have objective validity in a synthetic judgment a priori. (A158/B197)
#+end_quote

- The categories are not simply the most fundamental ways of thinking about objects, there are also the most fundamental ways for /being/ objects -- i.e. the categories are essential to /being/ an object. 
- Given this it would be surprising if Kant were making a merely epistemological argument in the Analogies

#+begin_quote
it is only because we subject the sequence of the appearances and thus all alteration to the law of causality that experience itself, i.e., empirical cognition of them [i.e. the sequence of appearances], is possible; consequently they themselves, as objects of experience, are possible only in accordance with this law. (B234)
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[t]hese, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing other than principles of the determination of the existence of appearances in time, in accordance with all three of its /modi/: that of the relation to time itself, as a magnitude (the magnitude of existence, i.e., duration); that of the relation in time, as a series (one after another); and finally that in time as a sum of all existence (simultaneous). (A215/B262)
#+end_quote

**** Time, Causality, & the PSR

Kant makes two references to the principle of sufficient reason (or "determining ground") in the Analogies. The first comes in the Second Analogy.

1. This rule for determining something with respect to its temporal sequence, however, is that in what precedes, the condition is to be encountered under which the occurrence always (i.e., necessarily) follows. Thus the principle of sufficient reason is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective cognition of appearances with regard to their relation in the successive series of time. (A200-1/B246)

2. If we had wanted to prove these analogies dogmatically, i.e., from concepts...then all effort would have been entirely in vain. For one cannot get from one object and its existence to the existence of another or its way of existing through mere concepts of these things, no matter how much one analyzes them. So what is left for us? The possibility of experience, as a cognition in which in the end all objects must be able to be given to us if their representation is to have objective reality for us. In this third thing, now, the essential form of which consists in the synthetic unity of the apperception of all appearances, we found a priori conditions of the thoroughgoing and necessary time-determination of all existence in appearance, without which even empirical time-determination would be impossible, and we found rules of synthetic a priori unity by means of which we could anticipate experience. In the absence of this method, and in the delusion of wanting to prove dogmatically synthetic propositions that the empirical use of the understanding recommends as its principles, a proof of the principle of sufficient reason was often sought, but always in vain. (A217/B264-5)

- Only the method of transcendental argument can apply any justification for the PSR
- Kant argues that though we are justified in applying the PSR to appearances, understood as alterations of substances (objects), we can utilize this principle only /within/ the bounds of possible experience, and the impetus of reason (as a faculty) to seek the unconditioned condition (or totality) of given conditions will never be satisfied; thus is the application of the PSR both justified and stringently limited.

- [X] Introduction to Material
- [X] Leibniz & PSR
- [X] Varieties of PSR
- [X] In what sense if any is PSR required for inquiry to be possible?

   + [X] Features of the "reason" or "ground" relation
      * transitive, asymmetric, and irreflexive?
   + [X] Does Descartes accept the standard form of ground relation?
      - [X] Is Descartes's conception of God as self-caused a problem for standard form?
   + [X] Does Descartes's view of universality of PSR_ontic indicate he endorses the universal intelligibility of all things?

*** Questions
- Seungchul:
   1) Do we need to assume determinism to understand E1a3?
   2) How to derive the claim (call this claim α) that from the order of Nature it must follow either that the triangle necessarily exists now or that it is impossible for it to exist now? and How to derive, from α, the claim that a thing necessarily exists if there is no reason or cause which prevents it from existing? 
- Eunhong: How can we—the mere modes— can infer the substance? I think that the only substance that can be discovered through modes is the substance as mode, not the substance ipso facto.
- Janelle: The question that I have is whether or not ideas can be limited by bodies given A6
- Kendric:
   1) Is a mode an infinite collection of things (e.g. a mode of extension that infinitely spans time and all of space) or is an infinite mode supposed to be shorthand for an infinite series or "package" of modes?
   2) It seems that, when wielding the PSR, one can only reasonably come up with a direct, one-hop, connection between things or a collection of infinitely many things. Restricted this way, will this be able to solve our metaphysical needs?
   3) Why is MDR so good?
- Jessica:
   1) how do we as a reader and the author define “its own kind” in reference to infinite and finite?
   2) A physical thing can not exist correct but can we as the reader use the definition of essence or the word to apply to a non-physical thing that can exist (ex; thoughts and ideas)?
   3) how are we defining substance and it’s attributes? If no two substances can share an attribute why can God contain all attributes but can still only be considered one substance??
- Jack:
   1) it doesn’t seem possible to have a positive conception of God (at least not in the sense that we can have a positive conception of the aforementioned examples). And so it looks like Not-wide is the only natural thing to say.
- Youmin:
   1) Descartes talks about the differences in where attributes are involved in things or thoughts. It seems he tries to give an example from the difference between time and duration which distinction is in thought. However, I can't get the connection between this distinction, the explanation of some attributes originated from though, and the theory of sufficient reason of fact.
   2) other paragraphs of Descartes seem to try to distinguish attributes that are involved in a thing or a thought. Then, how this distinction is connected to the ground of the fact? Is the way of being the same as the reason for being (or fact)?
- Il-Hwan:
   1) P5 & P8 are problematic
- Victor:
   1) Problems w/P28
       1) in what capacity is God the cause of the existence of finite things at all (since their finite existence does not follow from his absolute nature) and, even more importantly
       2) in what sense is then their existence necessary (since they seem to necessarily follow from each other within the realm of natura naturata)?
